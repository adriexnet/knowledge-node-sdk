Knowledge.io is producing an ecosystem that offers significant improvement in the areas of ad tech, commerce, education, and employment, and a supply and demand marketplace of goods and services, all based around rewarding users for what the massive and centralized supergiants utilize to make extraordinary profits - people’s data. The Knowledge.io ecosystem is built on the foundation of decentralization and rewarding people for sharing their knowledge.
